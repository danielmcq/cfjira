ColdFusion Jira
======

This project aims to be a small sets of tools which leverage the Jira REST API.
Since ColdFusion is the current web front-end coding language of choice at my
current company, lots of this is being implemented in that language. Thus the
name, "ColdFusion Jira".

In reality, the code in this repository could be separated out in to distinct
ColdFusion and UI ( HTML, CSS, JavaScript ) projects. But for now, it's all
lumped together for the convenience of the developer.
